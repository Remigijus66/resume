I have skills of Responsive design and can do Object Oriented programming. Understand REST API and can work with databases. And above on all that,
          I think I have learners mindset, I am keen and ready for a new things in this area. </p>
        <p>In 2023 I was working in a team, developing gamifying plugin for e-shops. It delivers fun games directly to the shop, suprises customers, brings in discounts, and makes shopping procedures more lively. In this site you will find some of the games built by me. </p>
        <p> In this site I've also added my small project, which I skeched just for myself. It is an API based world-wide wheather forecast app.</p>
